# Bulb-Onion-Size-Classification-and-Mass-Estimation
This project involved developing a machine learning pipeline to estimate the mass and classify the size of bulb onions (red and yellow). It integrated a YOLOv8 segmentation model for object detection with regression models for accurate size and mass prediction, using a dataset of annotated images.
